</SH>


The feature code focuses on performing a specific task, which is explained in detail below.

<SH level="3" id="h-function-1-calculatesum">
Function 1: calculateSum
</SH>


This function calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result. It takes two parameters, <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>, representing the numbers to be added together. The function uses the <code>+</code> operator to perform the addition and returns the sum.

<SCodeBlock language="plain text" focus="" filename="" tabid="0">

```plain text
function calculateSum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```
</SCodeBlock>

<SH level="4" id="h-example-usage">
Example Usage:
</SH>


<SCodeBlock language="plain text" focus="" filename="" tabid="0">

```plain text
const result = calculateSum(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```
</SCodeBlock>

<SH level="3" id="h-function-2-findmax">
Function 2: findMax
</SH>


This function finds the maximum value from an array of numbers and returns it. It takes one parameter, <code>numbers</code>, which is an array of numbers. The function uses the <code>Math.max()</code> method to find the maximum value and returns it.

<SCodeBlock language="plain text" focus="" filename="" tabid="0">
